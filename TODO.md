# TODO

- [ ] Look into how the router and server.ts interact currently serving
      index.html over and over
- [ ] Tree shaking the CSS
- [ ] Authenticated routes to support user roles
- [ ] Server-side rendering?
- [ ] Can we load the current LightDOM elements and slot them into the
      ShadowDOM?
- [ ] Can we dynamically split atlas-css into exportable pieces of lit element
      css objects
-
- [ ] Use https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/router instead of
      Vaadin?

## Later

- [ ] Update to decorators once https://github.com/lit/lit-element/issues/1030
